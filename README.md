### Predators and Prey CS474
___
Robert Hayhurst/Kamil Piekutowski<br>CS 474, University of Illinois at Chicago<br>Spring 2016<br><br>

### How to run this program
___
P&P was written on <strong>Code::Blocks</strong> using <em>SFML</em> graphics library, so the best way to run this program is to use Code::Blocks itself.

### Assignment Goals Met
___
The assignment asked us to use a design pattern, a GUI element, inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, of which this program has all of.  The design pattern that we used was the Factory pattern (at the bottom of the <em>Living_Being.h</em> file).  We have pure abstract classes for the animals, as well -- in fact, the top of the class tree starts with simply "Living Beings", and works its way down.  The classes are purely abstract until you get to the leaves of the class tree.


### Problems/Bugs
___
There is one bug that we can't seem to fix -- the program occasionally crashes due to a segmentation fault. Just run the program again when it happens.

Thanks!
